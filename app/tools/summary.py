    - If possible, organize the plan **by days (Ngày 1, Ngày 2, etc.)**.  
    - **Avoid repeating** the same restaurants, attractions, or activities across multiple days.  
    - Combine similar points into one section if repetition occurs.  
    - Ensure each day feels unique but consistent with the trip’s overall theme.
